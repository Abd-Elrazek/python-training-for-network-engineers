### What to find in thos project
A "Python for network enginners" course.   
It is useful to network engineers with no python programming knowledge, who wants to use python to manage junos devices.   
This is a hands-on training, with step-by-step instructions and many basics examples.   
The course covers an introduction to Python programming, it includes also the PyEZ library to interact with JUNOS devices as well as an overview of some other Python modules to manipulate IP addresses, files, regular expressions, templates and rest calls.   

### Presentations 
The presentations are available into this repo  
[- **Python-for-network-engineers.pdf**](https://github.com/ksator/python-for-network-engineers/blob/master/Python-for-network-engineers.pdf)  
[- **Python-training.pdf**](https://github.com/ksator/python-for-network-engineers/blob/master/Python-training.pdf) 

### Scripts
All the scripts are available into this project.  
The examples and code in this document are for learning and educational purposes.   
The samples were created with the goals of clarity and ease of understanding.   
If you are writing code for a real application, you would write some code differently :-)
